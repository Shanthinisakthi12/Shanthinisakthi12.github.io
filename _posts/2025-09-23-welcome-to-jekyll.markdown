# ðŸš€ Welcome to My Computer Science Advanced Series: A Roadmap

As an **assistant professor in Computer Science**, I often get asked by students and enthusiasts how to approach the vast landscape of CS topics. To make learning **structured and effective**, Iâ€™ve created a **series of advanced blog posts** across multiple domains in computer science. Each series is carefully planned to cover:

- **Theory**
- **Practical coding**
- **Problem-solving techniques**

Hereâ€™s a **roadmap of the series** and what you can expect:

---

## Series -1 -- Advanced Data Structures (ADS)

**Series Title:** *Beyond Arrays & Linked Lists â€“ Deep Dive into Data Structures*  

**Focus:**  
Mastering data structures that go beyond basic arrays and linked lists, understanding their **implementation, use cases**, and optimizing problem-solving skills for **interviews and competitive programming**.

---

### Planned Sub-Series

#### 1.1 Foundations of Advanced DS
- **Recap of basic data structures** for context  
- Introduction to:
  - **Trees**  
  - **Graphs**  
  - **Heaps**  
  - **Hashing**  
- **Complexity analysis** and common pitfalls

#### 1.2 Advanced Data Structures
- **Segment Trees**  
- **Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees)**  
- **Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)**  
- **Trie, Suffix Trees, Sparse Tables**

#### 1.3 Placement Prep Questions
- Solve **real coding problems** using advanced structures  
- Step-by-step solutions in **C, Java, and Python**  
- **Time and space complexity discussion**  

---

### Why Read This Series
By the end of this series, readers will:  
- Implement advanced data structures with confidence  
- Solve complex problems **efficiently**  
- Gain an **edge in coding interviews and competitive programming**

---

**Next Steps:**  
Stay tuned for the first post in the series: **Foundations of Advanced Data Structures**, where weâ€™ll dive into **Trees, Graphs, Heaps, and Hashing** with **code examples and diagrams**.
