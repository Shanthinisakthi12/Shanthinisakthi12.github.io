# How to Learn AI in 2025: A Practical Checklist

Learning AI can feel overwhelming with all the courses, certifications, and tutorials out there. In 2025, the key is **learning by doing**, following the right creators, and building projects that matter. 
This guide gives you a **6-month roadmap**, creator-recommended resources, and a practical checklist to stay on track — without wasting time on endless certificates.

---


## 📍 Phase 1 — Foundations (Month 1)
**Goal:** Build your basics.  
- Learn Python ([Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) or [Google’s Python Course](https://developers.google.com/edu/python))  
- Brush up on Linear Algebra, Probability & Stats ([3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown))  
- Understand how a Neural Network learns — backpropagation, activation, loss, learning rate  
- Play with code on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)

---

## ⚙️ Phase 2 — Classical Machine Learning (Month 2)
**Goal:** Understand how models think.  
- Learn scikit-learn basics — regression, classification, k-means  
- Watch **Krish Naik** or **StatQuest** ML series on YouTube  
- Build a simple project (spam detection, house-price prediction)  
- Read *Machine Learning Q and AI* by **Sebastian Raschka**

---

## 🧠 Phase 3 — Deep Learning (Months 3–4)
**Goal:** Move from ML to DL.  
- Learn PyTorch or TensorFlow basics  
- Understand CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers (see **Jay Alammar’s visual guides**)  
- Follow **Andrej Karpathy** for hands-on coding from scratch  
- Build a small image classifier or text generator  
- Explore the **Fast.ai** course (practical & beginner-friendly)

---

## 🤖 Phase 4 — Generative AI & LLMs (Month 5)
**Goal:** Understand modern AI trends.  
- Learn attention, embeddings, and tokenization  
- Try OpenAI API or Hugging Face models  
- Follow **Sahar Mor**, **Cameron R. Wolfe**, and **Damien Benveniste** for engineering insights  
- Build a small LLM app (chatbot, summarizer, Q&A bot)

---

## 🚀 Phase 5 — Deployment & Real-World Skills (Month 6)
**Goal:** Ship something useful.  
- Learn **Streamlit** or **Gradio** to deploy models  
- Read about MLOps basics  
- Deploy your model on **Hugging Face Spaces** or **Render**  
- Share your project on GitHub or LinkedIn — ask for feedback  

---

## 🧩 Optional — Stay Sharp
- Subscribe to **Sebastian Raschka’s “Ahead of AI”** for research summaries  
- Follow **The Cloud Girl (Priyanka Vergadia)** for structured AI roadmaps  
- Read **“The Illustrated Transformer”** by **Jay Alammar** once you reach attention models  
- Join communities: **r/learnmachinelearning**, **Weights & Biases Discord**, **Kaggle discussions**

---

### Final Tips
- Spend **4–5 hours per week** consistently.  
- Focus on **building and experimenting**, not certificates.  
- Track progress, reflect on mistakes, and share your work.  
- Real growth starts in **2 months**, but mastery comes in **8–12 months**.

> Remember: In 2025, your **projects, GitHub, and applied knowledge** matter more than certificates. Build, fail, iterate, and share.
