# Foundations of Advanced Data Structures

Welcome to the first post in our **Advanced Data Structures series**! Before diving into complex structures, it’s essential to solidify your foundation with basic data structures and a quick brush-up on C programming. This ensures you can tackle advanced topics confidently.

---

## 1. Quick Brush-Up on C Basics

Even if you're familiar with other languages like Python or Java, knowing C helps understand memory management and pointers, which are crucial for advanced data structures.

- **Variables & Data Types:** `int`, `float`, `char`, `double`
- **Pointers:** Understanding addresses, dereferencing, and pointer arithmetic
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** `malloc()`, `calloc()`, `free()`
- **Functions & Recursion:** Basics, passing by reference vs value
- **Structs:** Custom data types to represent nodes and complex structures

---

## 2. Arrays

Arrays are the building blocks of many data structures.

**Key Concepts:**
- Contiguous memory allocation
- Index-based access (`O(1)`)
- Static vs dynamic arrays
- Multi-dimensional arrays

**Common Operations:**
- Traversal
- Insertion / Deletion (costly in middle: `O(n)`)
- Searching (linear & binary search)
- Sorting (selection, bubble, insertion)


**Example in C:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    
    // Traversal
    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
    
    // Insertion at index 2
    int value = 10;
    for(int i = 4; i >= 2; i--) {
        arr[i+1] = arr[i];
    }
    arr[2] = value;
    
    printf("\nAfter insertion: ");
    for(int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
    
    return 0;
}

## 3. Linked Lists

Unlike arrays, linked lists provide dynamic memory usage.

**Types:**
1. **Singly Linked List (SLL)** – Node points to the next node
2. **Doubly Linked List (DLL)** – Node points to both previous and next
3. **Circular Linked List** – Last node points back to first

**Key Operations:**
- Traversal
- Insertion & Deletion at head, tail, or middle
- Searching for an element

**Advantages over Arrays:**
- Dynamic size
- Efficient insertion/deletion
- No wasted memory

---
## 4. Stacks

A stack is a **LIFO (Last In First Out)** structure.

**Implementation:**
- Using arrays
- Using linked lists

**Operations:**
- `push()` – add element
- `pop()` – remove top element
- `peek()` / `top()` – view top element
- `isEmpty()` – check if stack is empty

**Applications:**
- Expression evaluation
- Backtracking algorithms
- Undo feature in editors

---

## 5. Queues

A queue is a **FIFO (First In First Out)** structure.

**Types:**
- **Simple Queue** – Linear FIFO
- **Circular Queue** – Efficient memory usage
- **Priority Queue** – Elements with priority get served first
- **Deque (Double-Ended Queue)** – Insert/Delete from both ends

**Operations:**
- `enqueue()` – add element
- `dequeue()` – remove element
- `front()` / `rear()` – peek elements
- `isEmpty()` / `isFull()` – check status

**Applications:**
- CPU scheduling
- Print queue management
- BFS traversal in graphs

---

## Summary

In this post, we revisited the foundations of data structures:

- C programming essentials
- Arrays and their operations
- Linked lists (SLL, DLL, Circular)
- Stacks (LIFO)
- Queues (FIFO, Circular, Priority, Deque)

A solid understanding of these basics will make learning **advanced data structures** much smoother.
